YOLOv8 Wire Defect Detection - Cropped Dataset Model
=======================================================

Model Optimization:
  Target: Center crop focus (60% width) for better lighting
  Architecture: YOLOV8N
  Input size: 416x416
  Classes: fail (RED), pagan (BLUE), valid (GREEN)
  Training epochs: 150
  Classification loss weight: 1.0 (increased)

Cropped Dataset Optimizations:
  - Center crop to 60% width to focus on well-lit areas
  - Labels adjusted for cropped region
  - Reduced edge confusion from lighting variations
  - Enhanced fail detection in optimal lighting conditions
  - Maintained full height for complete wire visibility
Exported Models:
  PyTorch: models\best_cropped.pt
  ONNX: models\best_cropped.onnx

Usage for Fail Detection:
  # Load fail-sensitive model
  from ultralytics import YOLO
  model = YOLO('best_fail_sensitive.pt')
  
  # Lower confidence threshold for fail detection
  results = model('image.jpg', conf=0.15)  # Lower threshold
  
  # Filter for fail class only
  fail_detections = [box for box in results[0].boxes if int(box.cls[0]) == 0]
